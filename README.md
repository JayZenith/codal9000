# codal9000
AI-powered developer assistant (Work in Progress)

codal9000 is an AI-driven tool that helps developers automate repetitive tasks. Currently, it can:
- Automatically Generate Dockerfiles for your projects


## Planned Features
- Automated code refactoring and formatting
- Generating full test suites
- CI/CD pipeline optimization
- Repository analysis and suggestions
- Integration with other dev tools
- Create basic GitHub Actions CI workflows
- Scaffold minimal pytest tests


## Notes on Development
This project is being developed on a CPU-only laptop, so AI model inference is slower than on GPUs.

Some generated outputs (Dockerfiles, CI scripts) may occasionally be malformed due to model limitations;  am actively improving prompting, JSON parsing, and validation.

Contributions, suggestions, or fixes for robust AI output are welcome!


This project is actively in development. The current focus is bootstrapping containerized projects, but the vision is to grow into a full AI software development assistant.
